#Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# = this operator assign the value to variable from right side to left side
#Ex: Name = "Ramesh"
#== this operator basically compares the values of left side and right side if values are matched then returs True
#if values are mismatched then Returns False
#Example  if(10==10) True if(10==8) False

#What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# **  this is used to Calculate Power to the Value
#Example : Calculate 3 to the Power 3. print(3**3) = 27


#What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
# ^ this operator is used to perform Exclusive OR Condition or Bitwise Xor Condition
#Values will be convereted into Binary format then XoR will be Applied to them
# Example : print(3^4) = 7,(  3 in Binary 011 and 4 in Binary 100) --  011 XoR 100 = 111 = 7
